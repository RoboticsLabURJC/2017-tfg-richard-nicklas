## GPG Testing Distance Sensor

Trying to develop an FPGA verilog module that display the position of a red object in the camera frame via LEDs, code can be found [here](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2017-tfg-richard-nicklas/tree/master/GPG3/ICESTUDIO/RBallDetect_POC)

Still unsuccesfull attempts, will upload a video update when I finally manage to make it work.

I'm starting to use [apio](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio) to handle verilog code compilation and uploads to the fpga, it's a little bit more straight forward than IceStudio's visual interface.
